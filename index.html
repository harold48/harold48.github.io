Nevertheless, it was the passion for programming that drives me until the end. It was also that same passion that puts me in a pedestal in front of everyone as the Class valedictorian and Magna cum Laude of <strong>Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Ragay Branch</strong>. From that moment on, I've gained a decent weapon to face this tough world.</p>

Together with my manage and one new member, we research, discover and tried different things for the factory automation. On top of that, we develop <strong>PHP</strong> websites to gather, analyze and display vital manufacturing data and prepare them for future factory automation projects.</p>
